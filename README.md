# Learning-Computer-Graphics

Dear protagonist,

Now that we're done conversing with that foul mouthed version of you, lets move on..ã€€Let this be the last commit for now.

Good to see that we're finally catching up to the rest of the world. Lets keep up the pace and zoom past the frontrunners.

This is basically just a silly little readme for just another repository in whats hopefully going to be a large database, but being your first one, it holds some importance. It's fine that this message lies here; it's kinda symbolic. :)

Finish your books. Setup your life around you. Keep it well maintained. Learn something new everyday.
Let each decision you make, be made by keeping your ultimate goals in mind. 
Always remember that we are not satisfied by the mediocrity that most others have committed their lives to. It may seem awfully comforting at times, but by no means must we build a house at a place we considered an oasis.

Strength of mind and character; strive for it. You are yet young and have much to learn. But with the right direction and work, we can reach the heights that keep us from sleeping at night. 
You have people who care about you deeply. But most of all you have yourself. 

Godspeed.
